# movie-app-frontend

Frontend is implemented using [React](https://reactjs.org/) library and the app is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Frontend styling is done using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). Styled primitive components are defined in [primitive-components.jsx](./src/components/primitive-components.jsx)

## To start frontend in dev-mode

```
  npm install
  npm run start
```
